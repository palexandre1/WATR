# README from MVP Repo:
## Project Name
Where Are The Runs or WATR
## Heading
A map of where to play and how many people are playing ball in your area
## Sub-Heading
Hoopers can decide where they want to play
## Summary
If you're new in town and want to play basketball or want to switch up where you play, where do you go? Do you ask a friend, local, or call up a gym? Well no need for that anymore because now you can find what courts are currently active on your phone at anytime. Open a map and instantly see which areas have more activity and decide where to play. Get statistics on the level of competiton and peak hours of play.
## Problem
No longer will people have to look for Facebook groups or rely on word of mouth on where to play basketball. No more showing up to the court uninformed and being disappointed with the turnout of people.
## Solution
WATR collects data from users that 'check-in' to a court and use it to create a live visualization and statistics to provide enough detail to other users so they can decide if they want to play there or not.
## Quote from You
"If you're a competitor or you want to avoid the crowds you'll definitely want to download WATR and get the details on your area"
## How to Get Started
All you have to do is open the app and you can see where people are playing
## Customer Quote
"I moved here a few months ago and still havn't figured out where people play around here. I downloaded WATR and immediately found the active runs in my area. Now I always know where to go!"
